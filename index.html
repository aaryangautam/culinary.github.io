    <h1>Culinary Network Display</h1>

    <p> <b>Welcome to the taste network!</b>  Below is the graph that shows the entire flavor network, as pulled from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196#Sec8" target="_blank">Flavor Network Analysis</a>. This graph shows all the tastes that are similar and go well together. The slider shows the number of connections between the tastes, with a higher number meaning they are more similarly flavored. It was capped with a lower limit in order to keep the graph feasible to view.

    <p> <b>My hypothesis is that some sort of cooking liquid (olive oil, butter, vegetable oil, etc) will be in the top 10 most common ingredients for every cuisine.</b></p>

    <p> In this section, you can sort by regional cuisine in the drop down menu. These are pulled from the most common ingredients from a massive database of recipies in each cuisine. The table updates with the top most common ingredients and the number of recipies that can be made using this ingredient!

    <p> After analysis of each cuisine, the hypothesis was proven to be true. Every single one has a cooking base within the top 10 ingredients in the database. </p>

    <p> In this section, you can select multiple choices by regional cuisine in the menu. Based on what it is in your fridge, these are the most strongly utilized items. The color indicates how compatibale that ingredient is with your other ingredients, darker being more compatible and lighter being less compatible.
